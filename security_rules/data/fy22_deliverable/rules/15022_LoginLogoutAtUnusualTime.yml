description: This rule identifies situations in which Windows login and logout operations are performed or attempted outside the normal working hours (e.g., whenever operators work in shifts, this rule can ensure that such login and logout operations happen in the supposed timeframe). As attackers can try to take advantage of the absence of personnel to exploit the target systems, rules like these one work on restricting the categories of security-related events happening at unexpected time.
